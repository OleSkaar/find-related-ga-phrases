## Usage

This is a tool to help analyze and organize site search data from Google Analytics.

To use it, navigate to Behavior > Site Search > Search Terms, choose the time span you want data for, and choose Export > CSV.

Then, upload the CSV with drag and drop or browse, and it will connect all phrases that contain the same word.

For instance, if 10 users have searched for 'sleeping bag', and 5 users have searched for 'red sleeping bag', the phraseContainer 'sleeping bag' will now have 15 unique searches, and 'red sleeping bag' will be marked as a related phrase to 'sleeping bag'.
